        Many of today's electronics are basically specialized computers, though
        we don't always think of them that way. Here are a few common examples.
        Smartphones: Many cell phones can do a lot of things computers can do,
        including browsing the Internet and playing games. They are often called
        smartphones. Wearables: Wearable technology is a general term for a
        group of devices—including fitness trackers and smartwatches—that are
        designed to be worn throughout the day. These devices are often called
        wearables for short. Game consoles: A game console is a specialized type
        of computer that is used for playing video games on your TV. TVs: Many
        TVs now include applications—or apps—that let you access various types
        of online content. For example, you can stream video from the Internet
        directly onto your TV.
